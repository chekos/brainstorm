- **Timeline**: Strict scope adherence, parallel development where possible

### Next Session
- Begin Phase 1: Enhanced SwiftData models for full feature set
- Implement core navigation shell (Today's Desk, Packet Dashboard)
- Set up architectural patterns and dependency injection

### Phase 1 Completion (Same Day)
- **Enhanced Data Models**: Created comprehensive SwiftData models for Packet, PacketSection, ChecklistItem, and Capture
- **Navigation Shell**: Implemented MainNavigationView with Today's Desk and Packet Dashboard
- **UI Components**: Built reusable components (ProgressCardView, CaptureTypeIcon, HotkeyLabel)
- **Service Architecture**: Created DataService and ServiceContainer for dependency injection
- **Progress Tracking**: Added rich progress indicators and status management

### Technical Achievements
- **Model Relationships**: Proper SwiftData relationships with cascade deletion
- **Performance**: Built with performance budgets in mind (UI components optimized)

### Known Issues
- **Build Configuration**: Signing requirements need resolution for local development
- **Missing Features**: Core capture functionality not yet implemented (Phase 3)
- **Testing**: Unit tests need to be added for data models and services

### Build Configuration Resolution
- **Issue**: Entitlements file included CloudKit + app sandboxing requiring paid developer account
- **Solution**: Simplified entitlements to basic file access only for local development
- **Impact**: App now builds and runs locally without Apple Developer account
- **Future**: CloudKit entitlements can be re-added when needed for iCloud sync

### Build Command Resolution
- **Root Cause**: SwiftData @Relationship circular references + iOS-specific UI modifiers
- **Fixed**: Simplified relationships, removed `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode()`, fixed color system
- **Result**: Clean build with `xcodebuild -project brainstorm.xcodeproj -scheme brainstorm build`
- **Local Development**: Fully functional for Phase 1 architecture

### Phase 2 Completion - Packet System
- **PDF Import**: Drag-drop and file browser support with visual feedback
- **PDF Parsing**: Intelligent section detection using multiple heuristics
- **Section Detection**: Handles numbered headings, caps text, title case, roman numerals
- **Auto-Checklist**: Generates actionable items from document structure
- **Section Viewer**: Detailed view of parsed content with type classification
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with retry options
- **Performance**: Async processing with progress indicators

### Technical Implementation
- **PDFService**: Comprehensive PDF processing with PDFKit integration
- **Import Flow**: Modal workflow with state management (ready→importing→completed/failed)
- **Content Classification**: Section types (heading, content, figure, code, quote, list, task)
- **UI Components**: PDFDropZone, PDFImportView, PacketSectionsView
- **Integration**: Full service container integration with dependency injection
