- **Platform Features**: Global hotkeys, window management, desktop workflows

### Roadmap Creation
- **Created**: Comprehensive ROADMAP.md with 8-phase development plan
- **Analysis**: Deep dive into PRD v2 and Q&A transcript for feature prioritization
- **Phases**: Foundation → Core Architecture → Packet System → Multi-Modal Capture → Brainstorm Mode → AI Integration → Polish → Launch
- **Timeline**: ~6 months from current state to launch readiness
- **Business Alignment**: Roadmap targets $1.8M ARR goal with 75k users @ $10/mo

### Technical Decisions from Roadmap Analysis
- **Must-Have v1 Features**: Packet import/parsing, multi-modal capture, brainstorm mode (from Q&A)
- **Performance Budgets**: All PRD targets maintained as hard requirements
- **AI Strategy**: Hybrid cloud-first with local fallback (< 4GB local model)
- **Storage**: iCloud Drive sync in ~/Library/Application Support/WorkbenchAI/
- **Visual Design**: Terracotta accent, IBM Plex Serif, minimalist calm aesthetic

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Technical**: Chunked parsing for large PDFs, progressive quality degradation
- **Business**: Closed beta validation, A/B pricing tests
- **Timeline**: Strict scope adherence, parallel development where possible

### Next Session
- Begin Phase 1: Enhanced SwiftData models for full feature set
- Implement core navigation shell (Today's Desk, Packet Dashboard)
- Set up architectural patterns and dependency injection

### Phase 1 Completion (Same Day)
- **Enhanced Data Models**: Created comprehensive SwiftData models for Packet, PacketSection, ChecklistItem, and Capture
- **Navigation Shell**: Implemented MainNavigationView with Today's Desk and Packet Dashboard
- **UI Components**: Built reusable components (ProgressCardView, CaptureTypeIcon, HotkeyLabel)
- **Service Architecture**: Created DataService and ServiceContainer for dependency injection

- **Reusability**: Component library for consistent UI patterns

### Known Issues
- **Build Configuration**: Signing requirements need resolution for local development
- **Missing Features**: Core capture functionality not yet implemented (Phase 3)
- **Testing**: Unit tests need to be added for data models and services

### Build Configuration Resolution
- **Issue**: Entitlements file included CloudKit + app sandboxing requiring paid developer account
- **Solution**: Simplified entitlements to basic file access only for local development
- **Impact**: App now builds and runs locally without Apple Developer account
- **Future**: CloudKit entitlements can be re-added when needed for iCloud sync

### Build Command Resolution
- **Root Cause**: SwiftData @Relationship circular references + iOS-specific UI modifiers
- **Fixed**: Simplified relationships, removed `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode()`, fixed color system
- **Result**: Clean build with `xcodebuild -project brainstorm.xcodeproj -scheme brainstorm build`
- **Local Development**: Fully functional for Phase 1 architecture

### Phase 2 Completion - Packet System

### Critical Bug Fix - Memory Management Crash Resolution
- **Issue**: Multiple crashes during CaptureHUD testing - EXC_BAD_ACCESS, EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION, "API MISUSE: Resurrection of an object"
- **Root Cause**: Memory management issues with service container lifecycle and @MainActor isolation
- **Solution**: Fixed ServiceContainer initialization and deinit patterns with proper threading
- **Implementation**: Simplified service wiring, fixed deinit cleanup with Task { @MainActor }
- **Result**: ✅ App builds and launches successfully, ready for end-to-end testing

### Technical Implementation
- **Service Container**: Removed async DispatchQueue wiring, simplified to direct initialization
- **Memory Management**: Added proper cleanup in deinit using Task { @MainActor } for thread safety
- **Actor Isolation**: Fixed @MainActor compliance in ServiceContainer cleanup
- **Build Success**: Resolved all compilation errors and memory management warnings

### Memory Management Lessons Learned
- **@MainActor Isolation**: deinit runs on arbitrary threads, requires Task wrapper for MainActor access
- **Service Lifecycle**: Weak references in HotkeyService prevent retain cycles
- **Threading Safety**: ServiceContainer initialization can be synchronous since it's @MainActor
- **Cleanup Patterns**: Async cleanup in deinit prevents crashes during object deallocation

### Critical Privacy Permissions Fix
- **Issue**: TCC crash when accessing speech recognition - "NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription key missing"
- **Root Cause**: Info.plist missing required privacy usage descriptions for speech recognition and microphone
- **Solution**: Added NSMicrophoneUsageDescription and NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription to Info.plist
- **Implementation**: Clear user-facing descriptions explaining voice note functionality
- **Result**: ✅ App launches successfully, ready for speech recognition testing

### Privacy Descriptions Added
- **Speech Recognition**: "brainstorm uses speech recognition to convert your voice notes into text for study packets and brainstorm sessions."
- **Microphone**: "brainstorm needs microphone access to record voice notes and capture your thoughts during study sessions."
- **macOS Compliance**: Follows Apple's privacy guidelines for sensitive data access
- **User Experience**: Clear explanations of feature benefits and data usage

### Critical SwiftData Relationship Fix
- **Issue**: EXC_BREAKPOINT crash in PDF import when setting ChecklistItem.packet relationship
- **Root Cause**: Manual relationship setting conflicted with SwiftData's automatic relationship management
- **Solution**: Removed manual `item.packet = packet` assignments, let SwiftData handle via `packet.checklistItems`
- **Implementation**: Updated PDFService.generateChecklistItems to rely on SwiftData's relationship management
- **Result**: ✅ PDF import now works without relationship crashes

### SwiftData Relationship Best Practices
- **Bidirectional Relationships**: Let SwiftData manage inverse relationships automatically
- **Cascade Management**: Use `@Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade)` on parent entities
- **Consistency**: Avoid manual relationship setting when using collection assignment
- **Model Context**: Always insert models before setting relationships in collections

### Phase 4 Status: ✅ ALL CRASHES RESOLVED  
- CaptureHUD service initialization fully resolved
- Memory management patterns established for future development
- Privacy permissions properly configured for speech recognition
- SwiftData relationship management fixed for PDF import
- App launches successfully and ready for comprehensive testing
- Foundation solid for Phase 4B: iCloud Drive sync integration

### PDF Import Dialog Sizing Fix
- **Issue**: User feedback indicated PDF import dialog was too small, "Open Packet" button was cut off
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive frame constraints and improved layout in PDFImportView
- **Implementation**: 
  - Sheet frame constraints: `minWidth: 500, minHeight: 400, idealWidth: 600, idealHeight: 500`
  - Enhanced completedView with proper vertical spacing using `Spacer()` elements
  - Improved button layout with `.controlSize(.large)` for better visibility
  - Info card with `.frame(maxWidth: 400)` for consistent sizing
- **Result**: ✅ PDF import dialog now properly sized with fully visible buttons and improved navigation

- **Result**: ✅ Real OpenAI integration working - users can now get genuine AI-powered document analysis

### Critical UI/UX Readability Improvements
- **Issue**: User feedback indicated extremely small, hard-to-read text throughout the interface
- **Root Cause**: Excessive use of `.caption`, `.caption2` fonts and insufficient spacing making interface cramped
- **Solution**: Comprehensive typography and spacing overhaul across all UI components
- **Implementation**:
  - **Typography Scale**: Upgraded font hierarchy from caption-heavy to proper scale
    - Main titles: `.headline` → `.title` and `.title3` for better prominence
    - Body text: `.caption` → `.subheadline` for improved readability
    - Card content: Enhanced from `.caption2` to `.caption` and `.subheadline`
    - Metadata: Upgraded to more readable font sizes throughout
  - **Spacing Enhancement**: Increased padding and margins across components
